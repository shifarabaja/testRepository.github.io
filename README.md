This is my first Github repository. A Github repository can be compared to a folder. This repository is a project that can have many files but it must have an index.html file. All Github repositories MUST HAVE the .github.io extension.

You can think of a Github repository as a folder. Although a repository contains several files, it always needs an inex.html file. The class's Github repositories have to be open to the public. This means that anyone who has the link can view this repository.
